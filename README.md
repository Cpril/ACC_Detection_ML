# ACC Detection ML (in progress)

Agenesis of Corpus Collosum is usually detected by MRI, which is an expensive test to conduct. Therefore, people with Agenesis of Corpus Collosum are often diagnoised later in life, missing out on the prime treatment interference period in early developmental stages. 
This project aim to create a machine learning model that can detect complete Agenesis of Corpus Collosum through EEG recordings.

This project is derived from an ongoing study on ACC and EEG Coherence by professor Moes at Calvin University. I was part of the research team in data collection, and is given premission to use this data for this personal project.

This project is still in progress. Technical Report will be shared once the project is complete and result reviewed for accuracy and interpretability. :)
